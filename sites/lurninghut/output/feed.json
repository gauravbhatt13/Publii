This caused a very common issue '<strong>src refspec main does not match</strong>' due to the fact that when we go to Github and create a new repository, it now names it as 'main' instead of 'master' as shown in below images,  while when we do 'git init' in our local machine and commit, it will create a branch named 'master'. So when we try to push that branch to Github it complains with the error '<strong>src refspec main does not match'. </strong>Following image show step by step order to recreate the error.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create new repository in Github.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/cropped.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-xs.png 300w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-sm.png 480w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-md.png 768w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-lg.png 1024w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-xl.png 1360w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"249\" height=\"209\"></figure><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/cropped-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-2-xs.png 300w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-2-sm.png 480w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-2-md.png 768w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"561\" height=\"331\"></figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Create new repository in local machine</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); font-size: 17.7235px; outline: 3px solid rgba(var(--primary-color-rgb), 0.55)  !important;\" src=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/cropped-4.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-4-xs.png 300w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-4-sm.png 480w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-4-md.png 768w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-4-lg.png 1024w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-4-xl.png 1360w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-4-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"567\" height=\"375\"></figure>\n<p>Note that the local branch name is master.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set upstream and push</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the instruction mentioned in the step one image to add remote origin and push:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/cropped-6.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-6-xs.png 300w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-6-sm.png 480w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-6-md.png 768w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-6-lg.png 1024w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-6-xl.png 1360w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/17/responsive/cropped-6-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1216\" height=\"160\"></figure>\n<h4>SOLUTION</h4>\n<p>Following steps would help in resolving the issue:</p>\n<p>Rename the current branch to main</p>\n<pre>git branch -m master main</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the local branch is renamed try the git push -u origin main again and you should see the upload.</p>\n<h4><br><br>Configure GIT default directory</h4>\n<p>Also make sure that we change the git configuration to configure default directory as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"lj lk ll lm ln ow gv be\"><span id=\"b2cc\" class=\"ej ox mu dm ov b kn oy oz s pa\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">git config --global init.defaultBranch main<br></span></pre>\n<p>The above command will make sure that every next time you create a new git repository locally, it will create default branch with 'main' as the branch name.</p>",

You can read this webpage because your browser just used this protocol to talk to the computer hosting this webpage using HTTP protocol. Let's break HTTP into smaller pieces to understand the concept.</p>\n<h4>H stands for HyperText</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Sistema_hipertextual.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\" ></p>\n<p>Any document file that we create may link to terms which have definition in some other document file stored locally or in another computer. Hypertext provides a way to link those information so that a complete graph of the document can be navigated just by following the links. This is a very powerful concept that is driving the content present on internet today. A markup language, which is popularly known as HTTP (Hypertext markup language) is used to describe such hyper text which can be understood by the browser and other clients and the documents created using it are known as HTML documents or webpages.</p>\n<h4>Transfer Protocol</h4>\n<p>Every protocol in computer world is governed by a set of rules. When two computer machines talk to each other, they need to follow guidelines to understand the signalling from each other. Purpose of HTTP is to transfer the hypertext between computers so that computers can request for a document or respond to a request by providing the document. Below image shows an HTTP request made using telnet (not browser) program.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Http_request_telnet_ubuntu.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\" ></p>\n<p>As we can see above, using rules around requesting and response we can complete transfer of hypertext document between computers.</p>\n<h4>HTTP is an Application Layer protocol</h4>\n<p>What is that? Well since HTTP protocol rule defines how to request for a document and what to expect as a response, it falls under the category of the application layer in various networking models like OSI model or TCP/IP suite. Typically or protocols which define human interaction with a computer fall under the category of the Application layer. Refer to the below image for typical categorisation in OSI model:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/1033/tf6310_tc3_tcpip/Images/png/84433547__en-US__Web.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Beckhoff Information System - English\"></p>\n<h4> Basic Features</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://apps.testinsane.com/mindmaps/uploads/html/HTTP%20Hypertext%20Transfer%20Protocol_files/images/HTTP%20Hypertext%20Transfer%20Protocol.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\" ></p>\n<p>There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:</p>\n<ul class=\"list\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>HTTP is connectionless:</strong> The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each other during current request and response only. Further requests are made on new connection like client and server are new to each other.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/15/cropped1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/15/responsive/cropped1-xs.png 300w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/15/responsive/cropped1-sm.png 480w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/15/responsive/cropped1-md.png 768w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/15/responsive/cropped1-lg.png 1024w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/15/responsive/cropped1-xl.png 1360w ,https://lurninghut.com/media/posts/15/responsive/cropped1-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1268\" height=\"716\"></figure>\n<ul class=\"list\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>HTTP is media independent:</strong> It means, any type of data can be sent (video, text, audio) over HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>HTTP is stateless:</strong> As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",

Lets see the problem with this:</p>\n<p>Such a setup is ok when the developer is running programs from a very personal machine or laptop as there can be some level of security that can be assumed but what about organisations with 100 developers. Are they going to create 100 set of long term credentials and manage them from IAM console ? Not a good idea. </p>\n<p>Another scenario is even for one set of credential, what if the developer wants to run a piece of AWS SDK based application in 10 different EC2 instances. In every instance those credentials should be copied. There must be a better way of doing it.</p>\n<p>What if there is a mobile app which needs to access AWS services and for that app there are 1000 users. It will not be wise to bundle long term credentials in mobile app.</p>\n<p>AWS provides IAM roles to be created for such scenarios but unlike IAM Users, such roles will have temporary credentials which can are not generated by IAM console, instead AWS STS service is called to get the temporary credentials.</p>\n<h4>STS and Roles chemistry</h4>\n<p>STS service (by default a global service but can be configured with region endpoints) has assume role action which is called by the client which need temporary credentials for any role they want to assume. For example if all the developers want to assume a 'dev' role created in IAM roles then they will call STS which will verify the trust relationship of the role with the client. Every role while being created in IAM will provide a trust policy specifying Principal who can assume the role like any specific user in any account or an EC2 service. The image below shows cross account access using IAM roles to allow user Joe in a different account to access Dynamo DB in another account.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/iam_delegate_cross_account_api_access_1.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Delegating API Access to AWS Services Using IAM Roles | AWS News Blog\"></p>\n<p> </p>",
